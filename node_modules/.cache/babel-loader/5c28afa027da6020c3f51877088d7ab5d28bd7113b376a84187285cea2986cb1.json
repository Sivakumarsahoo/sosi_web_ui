Using <CssBaseline> ensures that\r\n       text styling is consistent across browsers, as it applies a standard font family, font size, and line height.\r\n\r\n      Margins and Padding Differences: Many browsers add their own default padding and margin to certain elements (like <body>, <h1>, <p>)\r\n      . Without a baseline reset, these defaults may affect your design.\r\n\r\n      Unwanted Scrollbars: Some browsers might add extra space to the page or elements, causing unwanted scrollbars. Using <CssBaseline>\r\n       ensures that the page behaves more predictably.\r\n\r\n      While it's not strictly required, it's a helpful utility to standardize the appearance of your app across different environments. \r\n      You can always add custom styles later, but starting with a clean baseline can save time and effort in debugging layout issues. */}\r\n      <Outlet />\r\n      {/* In React Router (v6 and later), <Outlet /> is a component that is used to render nested routes.
